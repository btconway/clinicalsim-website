# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

## Shell Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Always quote file paths containing special characters (parentheses, spaces, etc.) in shell commands.

- ❌ `git diff app/(marketing)/insights/page.tsx` - Will fail with "no matches found"
- ✅ `git diff "app/(marketing)/insights/page.tsx"` - Works correctly

This applies to all shell commands including `git`, `ls`, `cat`, etc.

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application using the App Router with a component-driven architecture built on shadcn/ui and Radix UI primitives.

### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Components**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Toast**: Sonner

### Project Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components (auto-generated, avoid manual edits)
- `components/` - Custom components
- `lib/` - Utility functions (primarily `utils.ts` for cn helper)
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `public/` - Static assets

### Component System
The project uses shadcn/ui components which are:
- Built on Radix UI primitives
- Styled with Tailwind CSS using CSS variables
- Configured via `components.json`
- Installed via CLI (`npx shadcn@latest add <component>`)

### Styling Conventions
- Uses CSS variables defined in `app/globals.css` for theming
- Tailwind with custom color system (background, foreground, primary, etc.)
- `cn()` utility function from `lib/utils.ts` for conditional class merging
- Dark mode support via `class` strategy

### Path Aliases
- `@/*` - Project root
- `@/components` - Components directory
- `@/lib` - Library/utility functions
- `@/hooks` - Custom hooks

### Build Configuration
- ESLint and TypeScript errors ignored during builds
- Images unoptimized for static export compatibility

## Content Management

### Blog Posts (Insights)
- **Location**: `app/(marketing)/insights/[slug]/page.mdx`
- **Registry**: `lib/posts.ts` - Must be updated when adding new posts
- **Layout**: Posts use `components/article-layout.tsx` wrapper
- **Workflow**: Blog posts may be created by separate agents/processes
  - Always check `lib/posts.ts` for the current list of posts
  - Verify new posts are registered in the posts array with metadata
  - Ensure MDX files follow the ArticleLayout pattern
  - **IMPORTANT**: When multiple agents work on this codebase, always pull latest changes before making commits to avoid conflicts with blog post additions

### MDX Content Guidelines
- Use `page.mdx` files that import ArticleLayout component
- Escape special characters: `p<0.001` → `p&lt;0.001`
- Follow established tag conventions (see Insights page for color coding)

## Design System (Updated Feb 2026)

### Custom Components Library
**Feature Components:**
- `components/feature-card.tsx` - Asymmetric cards with border glow hover, color variants (default, warm, navy, success)
- `components/stat-highlight.tsx` - Large statistics with IBM Plex Mono font, multiple color variants
- `components/evidence-showcase.tsx` - RCT study display with badges and citations

**Layout Components:**
- `components/asymmetric-grid.tsx` - Flexible layouts: featured-left/right, staggered, mixed
- `components/section-divider.tsx` - SVG dividers: diagonal-down/up, wave, curve

**Media Components:**
- `components/demo-video-section.tsx` - Video embed with custom warm accent play button
- `components/screenshot-gallery.tsx` - Lightbox gallery with keyboard navigation

### Color System
- **Primary**: Blue (#3B82F6) - Brand identity, navigation
- **Warm Accent**: Orange (#F97316) - CTAs, metrics, highlights - `text-warm`, `bg-warm`, `border-warm`
- **Success**: Green (#10B981) - Outcomes, testimonials - `text-success`, `bg-success`
- **Navy**: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) - Authority, headers - `text-navy`, `bg-navy`

### Typography
- **Primary**: Poppins (300-700) - All body text, headlines, UI
- **Secondary**: IBM Plex Mono (400-700) - Statistics, data - `font-mono` class

### Button Variants
- `gradient-primary` - Blue-indigo-purple gradient with shimmer
- `warm-accent` - Orange border with sliding fill animation
- `warm-filled` - Solid warm accent background
- `text-link` - Animated underline on hover

### Border Radius System
- `rounded-xs` (4px), `rounded-sm` (6px), `rounded-md` (8px), `rounded-lg` (8px), `rounded-xl` (16px), `rounded-2xl` (24px)
- **Guideline**: Vary based on component importance, avoid uniform 8px everywhere

## Hallucination Prevention

This is a healthcare/medical education site. Accuracy is non-negotiable.

- **NEVER fabricate statistics, study results, journal names, or citations.** If you don't know the real source, say so — do not invent one.
- **NEVER invent CPT codes, reimbursement rates, or regulatory claims.** Verify against existing site content or ask the user for the source.
- **Before writing any claim with a number, percentage, or dollar amount:** confirm it exists in the codebase already OR the user has provided it. Do not extrapolate or round existing stats into new ones.
- **Quotes and testimonials:** Only use quotes that already exist in the codebase. Never generate fake testimonials.
- **When in doubt, leave it out.** A page with no citation is better than a page with a fabricated one. Flag uncertain claims to the user rather than guessing.
- **Existing site content is not automatically trustworthy.** If something on the site looks wrong or unsourced, flag it rather than propagating it into new content.

## GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Guidelines

All content on this site must be optimized for discovery by AI search systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, etc.). Follow these rules when creating or modifying pages:

### Page Metadata (Required for all TSX pages)
- Every page MUST have `export const metadata: Metadata` with: `title`, `description`, `openGraph` (title, description, url), `twitter` (title, description), and `alternates.canonical`
- Root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) uses `metadataBase` and template titles (`%s | ClinicalSim.ai`)
- Descriptions should include specific stats and source references where possible

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)
- Use `components/json-ld.tsx` helper for all structured data
- Marketing layout includes Organization + WebSite schemas
- Blog posts include Article schema via `components/article-layout.tsx`
- Solution pages include BreadcrumbList + FAQPage schemas via `components/solution-page-layout.tsx`
- When adding new page types, add appropriate JSON-LD schema

### Citation Magnets & Extractable Content
- Include self-contained, quotable definition blocks (2-3 sentences with a stat + source)
- FAQ sections on solution pages: clear Q/A format, self-contained answers, each with a stat + source
- "Key Takeaway" blocks at the top of high-value blog posts: 1 quotable sentence + stat
- All statistics must include their source attribution

### Content Structure for AI Discoverability
- Use clear heading hierarchy (H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
- Write self-contained paragraphs — avoid ambiguous pronouns; AI systems extract individual passages
- Include specific numbers, CPT codes, dollar amounts, and percentages with source citations
- FAQ answers should be independently understandable without reading the question

### Infrastructure Files
- `app/robots.ts` — Crawler rules; blocks GPTBot (training) while allowing search crawlers
- `app/sitemap.ts` — Auto-generated from `lib/posts.ts`, `lib/solutions.ts`, `lib/audiences.ts`
- `public/llms.txt` — Page index for LLM crawlers; update when adding/removing pages
- When adding new pages, update `app/sitemap.ts` and `public/llms.txt`

### Solution Page Data (`lib/solutions.ts`)
- `faqs` field: Array of `{ question, answer }` for FAQ section + FAQPage JSON-LD
- `lastUpdated` field: ISO date string displayed in hero section
- When modifying solution page content, update `lastUpdated` date
