## The Challenge

The business case for communication training is clear: reduced malpractice risk, improved HCAHPS scores, and better outcomes.

## Key Insights

- **Scalability**: Modern training solutions must reach all learners, not just a select few
- **Consistency**: Every trainee deserves the same high-quality practice opportunities
- **Assessment**: Validated feedback mechanisms are essential for skill development
- **Accessibility**: Training should be available when and where learners need it

## The Research

Recent developments in medical communication training continue to show the importance of structured, repeatable practice. With communication failures driving 40% of malpractice claims and HCAHPS scores putting millions in reimbursement at risk, the stakes have never been higher.
