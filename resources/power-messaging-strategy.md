# ClinicalSim.ai — Power Messaging Strategy Prompt

You are an expert B2B messaging strategist and researcher specializing in healthcare technology sales. Your task is to develop differentiated, C-level-relevant positioning (distinct points of view) for **ClinicalSim.ai**, grounded in evidence and the "Power Messaging" frameworks (Grabber → Pain → Impact → Contrast → Proof; Value Wedge; Power Positions; Hero/Villain; Stories with Contrast; Big Picture).

## About ClinicalSim.ai

ClinicalSim.ai is an AI-powered voice simulation platform that lets physicians practice difficult patient and family conversations on-demand. Core capabilities include:

- **Real-time voice conversations** with AI standardized patients (not text-based chatbot — actual spoken dialogue)
- **Pre-built scenario library** covering end-of-life discussions, new diagnoses, breaking bad news, organ donation, goals of care, medical error disclosure, and more
- **Custom scenario creation** for institution-specific training needs
- **Automated performance feedback** using validated communication assessment frameworks (scored on empathy, language sensitivity, information delivery, emotional responsiveness)
- **Conversation transcripts and audio recordings** for review and progress tracking
- **Multi-language support** for diverse training environments
- **24/7 on-demand access** from any mobile device — no scheduling, no sim center booking, no SP coordination

**Pilot evidence:** In a randomized pilot study with pediatric critical care fellows, participants randomized to AI chatbot practice (plus standard didactic teaching) versus standard reflection alone showed:
- Clear increases in confidence and communication competence
- Improved scores on validated checklist-style assessment tools (scored by blinded evaluators)
- High perceived utility and realism ratings
- Reduced social anxiety and cognitive load during practice
- Qualitative feedback: learners valued rehearsing exact wording, the non-pressured format, and feeling more prepared for live simulations

**Key learner quotes from the pilot:**
- *"Practice/experience actually saying things"*
- *"Helpful to practice responses... and choose phrasing of the responses"*
- *"It was helpful to have time to think and reflect without feeling the pressure of a person across from you expecting a response"*

## 1) Context and assets you must use first (internal)

Start by extracting insights from the following internal materials (do not skip):

### A. Power Messaging framework summary (from *Conversations That Win the Complex Sale*)

**Core frameworks to apply:**

- **Distinct Point of View pitch sequence:** Grabber → Pain → Impact → Contrast → Proof
- **Value Wedge:** What you can do for the customer that is (1) unique to you, (2) important to the customer, and (3) defensible
- **Triangulation:** Find prospect pain → match to competitor weakness → match to your differentiator → create a phrase capturing what the prospect can DO differently
- **Message Pyramid:** IS (features) → DOES (uniqueness) → MEANS (value/why it matters)
- **Hero Model:** The customer is the hero. The villain is never the prospect's people or systems — the villain is something that changed in the environment
- **YOU Phrasing:** "What if you could…", "What you'll be able to do is…", "You need to be able to…"
- **Power Positions:** "Only with us, you can do (PP1) and (PP2) and (PP3). So, where do we go from here?"
- **Grabber types:** "What-if-you-could" questions (2–3 in sequence), Number Plays (share info they didn't know), Customer Stories with Contrast, Props
- **Stories with Contrast:** Pain (before) → Gain (after) → Proof (impact metrics)
- **Big Pictures:** Visual you can draw on a napkin — customer obstacles → gains → memorable metaphor
- **Key principle:** "You need to earn the right to ask questions by sharing insights." Don't lead with features. Don't lead with proof too early. Create emotional momentum to change first, then use proof to make the old brain feel safe.

### B. Literature review on SP training effectiveness (provided document)

This comprehensive review of 20 studies (2015–2024) on standardized patient and simulation-based communication training establishes several key findings the messaging must reference:

- Pediatric residents consistently report feeling **underprepared for difficult conversations**, especially end-of-life care
- Traditional SP programs are **resource-heavy**: actors cost $15–50/hour each, require scheduling, space, faculty facilitators, and coordination
- **Peer role-play achieves equivalent outcomes to professional SPs at ~65% of the cost** (Bosse et al., 2015) — proving the interaction modality matters less than the practice itself
- **Psychological realism is critical** — trainees learn more when emotionally invested in authentic scenarios (Wilson 2019, Albert 2021)
- **Just-in-time training works**: pocket reference cards reviewed before real conversations improved both self-efficacy (p<0.001) and faculty-observed performance (p<0.001) (Kube et al., 2024)
- **Most programs rely on ad-hoc methods** like observation and role-modeling; only a minority formally teach all ACGME communication competencies (Reed et al., 2020 survey)
- **No pediatric studies have shown direct patient outcome improvements** — this is a gap in the field
- **Skills may atrophy** without reinforcement; retention data beyond 3 months is limited
- **Real EOL conversations are rare in training**, making deliberate practice nearly impossible with conventional methods

### C. IPSSW 2025 presentation data (Havalad & Brennan pilot study)

Key data points to reference:
- **Study design:** PICU fellows randomized — all received didactic teaching; intervention group got chatbot practice before simulation; control group got standard reflection period; groups then flipped so all participants experienced the software
- **Blinded evaluation:** All participants scored by blinded evaluator using validated checklist-style tool
- **AI feedback capability:** System can generate automated Communication Assessment Summary with Overall Score, Empathy Score, specific Strengths, and criteria-level scoring (e.g., "Using Appropriate & Sensitive Language: 4/5")
- **Qualitative themes:** Learners valued rehearsal of exact wording, reduced social pressure, structured feedback loop, and feeling prepared for live encounters
- **Conclusion:** Scalable, cost-effective, on-demand, feasible; supplements (does not replace) traditional SP training

### D. Deliverable requirement for internal extraction

Explicitly cite (by quoting short excerpts or paraphrasing with clear references to the internal material) the specific lines/ideas that support each insight you generate.

---

## 2) External research you must do (web)

After internal extraction, perform targeted web research to quantify and validate the business case and to find "grabber-grade" statistics. Prioritize authoritative sources (peer-reviewed journals, CMS/government data, ACGME publications, major consultancies, malpractice insurer reports, reputable benchmarks). Avoid weak sources and clearly label any vendor-commissioned studies.

You must find and cite (with links + publication dates) credible evidence for:

### A) Cost and resource burden of traditional standardized patient programs

- Cost per SP encounter (actor fees, space, faculty time, coordination overhead)
- Annual simulation center operating budgets at academic medical centers
- SP availability constraints and scheduling logistics
- Cost comparison: live SP vs. peer role-play vs. virtual/AI simulation
- Faculty time burden for facilitation and debriefing
- How many communication-focused simulation sessions the average resident receives per year

### B) Communication failures and their financial consequences

- Malpractice claims attributable to communication failures (% of total claims, total cost)
- CRICO/Candello benchmarking data on communication-related claims trends
- Average malpractice settlement and verdict amounts
- Hickson/Vanderbilt PARS data on patient complaints predicting malpractice risk
- Communication failures as root cause in sentinel events (Joint Commission data)
- Provider-patient communication complaints as percentage of total hospital grievances

### C) HCAHPS communication scores and financial impact

- CMS Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program mechanics (2% withhold, domain weights)
- Which HCAHPS domains directly measure communication skills
- Dollar amounts at risk for a mid-size academic medical center (400–500 beds)
- Published evidence of interventions that improved HCAHPS communication scores (AIDET, R.E.D.E., rounding protocols)
- Percentage of hospitals receiving VBP penalties
- Correlation between physician communication training and HCAHPS score improvement (Boissy et al./Cleveland Clinic study)

### D) ACGME requirements and the training gap

- Specific ACGME Common Program Requirements for Interpersonal and Communication Skills (Section IV.B.1.e)
- ACGME Milestones 2.0 Harmonized Milestones for communication
- Pediatrics-specific milestone requirements for difficult conversations, EOL care, breaking bad news
- Survey data showing how few programs formally teach all communication competencies
- ACGME citation/area-for-improvement data related to communication training deficiencies
- Resident survey data on preparedness for difficult conversations

### E) Macro environment changes that serve as the "villain" (must not blame customer people/systems)

- Rising malpractice claim frequency and severity trends
- Post-COVID communication challenges (telehealth EOL conversations, PPE barriers, remote family meetings becoming normalized)
- Increasing patient/family expectations for shared decision-making and transparency
- Workforce burnout and its impact on communication quality
- Shorter residency duty hours reducing experiential learning opportunities
- Growing emphasis on health equity requiring cross-cultural communication competence
- CMS and accreditor tightening of patient experience requirements
- The "low-frequency, high-stakes" problem: residents may encounter only 1–3 real EOL conversations during training
- Rising prevalence of complex chronic conditions requiring more goals-of-care conversations
- AI/technology disruption creating both opportunities and anxiety in medical education

---

## 3) Key research questions (answer all)

### Question 1: What are the top 5–8 C-level urgent problems ClinicalSim.ai's buyers face?

These problems must NOT be "we need a simulation tool" or "communication training is nice to have." They must be **boardroom-ready** (DIO, CFO, CMO, COO/CNO, Patient Safety Officer, Risk Management).

For each problem, specify:
- **Why it's urgent now** (what environmental shift is creating pressure)
- **Where money is lost** (malpractice, HCAHPS penalties, recruitment costs, faculty time, accreditation risk)
- **What the failure mode looks like** (the observable consequence if nothing changes)

Consider these buyer personas and their specific pressures:

| Buyer | Title | Primary pressure | Budget they control |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| DIO | Designated Institutional Official | ACGME accreditation, resident education quality, program competitiveness | GME budget |
| Program Director | Pediatrics/IM/Surgery PD | Milestone achievement, resident preparedness, ACGME survey scores | Departmental education budget |
| Simulation Center Director | Director of Clinical Simulation | Throughput, utilization, cost per encounter, demonstrating ROI | Simulation center budget |
| CMO | Chief Medical Officer | Patient safety events, malpractice exposure, provider competency | Patient safety/quality budget |
| CFO | Chief Financial Officer | HCAHPS/VBP revenue, malpractice insurance premiums, operating margin | Institutional budget |
| CNO/COO | Chief Nursing/Operating Officer | Interprofessional communication, care transitions, throughput | Operations budget |
| Risk Manager | VP Risk Management | Claims frequency/severity, communication-related grievances | Risk management budget |

### Question 2: What is ClinicalSim.ai's "value wedge"?

The Value Wedge must be: (1) unique to ClinicalSim.ai, (2) important to the customer, and (3) defensible.

Include competitor/alternative contrast against ALL of the following:

| Alternative | What it is | Its limitation |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **VitalTalk** | Gold-standard live communication training with simulated patients | $500–$1,500 per clinician, requires in-person attendance, cannot scale to all trainees, limited availability |
| **Traditional SP programs** | In-house sim center with hired actors | Expensive ($150–$300/encounter), scheduling bottleneck, limited to sim center hours, faculty-dependent, 2–4 sessions/year typical |
| **Peer role-play** | Residents practicing with each other | Free but lacks psychological realism, no validated feedback, no emotional fidelity, dependent on peer availability |
| **Oxford Medical Simulation (OMS)** | VR-based clinical simulation | Primarily clinical/procedural scenarios, requires VR headset hardware, not focused on communication-specific training |
| **SimX** | VR simulation with mannequin replacement focus | Hardware-dependent (VR headsets), focused on procedural/emergency scenarios, not communication-centric |
| **Aquifer** | Case-based virtual patient learning | Text-based passive learning, no voice interaction, no communication skill practice, assessment-focused |
| **Practicing Excellence** | Microlearning communication tips | Passive 5-minute video tips, no active practice, no simulation, no individualized feedback |
| **Ad-hoc faculty mentoring** | Attending role-modeling on rounds | Inconsistent quality, no structure, dependent on individual faculty skill, no assessment, not scalable |
| **No formal training** | Status quo at many programs | Violates ACGME intent, creates liability exposure, leaves residents unprepared |

Use **triangulation**: prospect pain → competitor weakness → ClinicalSim.ai differentiator.

### Question 3: What reframes are most provocative but credible?

Generate at least 4–6 distinct reframes (different villains, different executive angles). Example directions:

- "Your problem isn't that residents lack empathy — it's that they've never had a chance to practice a conversation they'll have once in training and remember for their entire career."
- "You're spending $X per standardized patient encounter to give residents 2–4 practice sessions a year. Your airline pilots get hundreds of hours in the simulator before they fly passengers. Why is the conversation where you tell a parent their child is dying any less high-stakes?"
- "Communication failures now drive 40% of malpractice claims. You insure against the lawsuits but you don't train against the root cause."
- "HCAHPS communication scores put $2–3M of your Medicare reimbursement at risk. You're optimizing rounding scripts when the real gap is that your physicians never practiced the hardest conversation they'll have this week."
- "The villain isn't your faculty — they're excellent clinicians. The villain is that difficult conversations are low-frequency, high-stakes events that your current training model can't adequately prepare anyone for."

Each reframe should name a different villain (environmental shift, not people).

### Question 4: What proof points (stats + mini stories) best support each reframe?

Provide specific metrics and ranges with sources. If evidence is inconsistent, explain variance and what's most believable. Prioritize:
- CRICO/Candello malpractice data
- CMS VBP/HCAHPS financial impact
- ACGME requirements and compliance data
- Cleveland Clinic R.E.D.E. study results
- Kube et al. just-in-time training results
- ClinicalSim.ai pilot study results
- Airline/aviation simulation analogy data (hours of sim training before live performance)

---

## 4) Output deliverables (strict format)

Produce the following sections in order:

### Section A — Internal insight extraction (from provided materials)

10–15 bullet insights pulled from the pilot study data, literature review, and ClinicalSim.ai context.

Each bullet must include:
- **"What the evidence shows"** (specific finding from internal materials)
- **"What it implies about the real pain"** (the underlying buyer problem)
- **"Messaging hook"** (how it becomes a point of view)

### Section B — External evidence library (for grabbers + proof)

A table with 15–25 high-quality stats, each with:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stat statement** | Short, punchy (suitable for a slide or opening line) |
| **Metric and context** | What it actually measures, sample size, methodology |
| **Source** | Link + publication date |
| **Credibility note** | Why trustworthy; any limitations |

### Section C — Differentiated Points of View (POVs)

Generate 4–6 POVs. Each POV must include:

1. **Name** (memorable, non-generic)
2. **Grabber:** 2–3 "What-if-you-could…" questions + 1 "number play" grabber
3. **Pain:** The underappreciated problem (unknown or underestimated by prospects)
4. **Impact:** Quantify urgency (time, cost, revenue leakage, risk)
5. **Contrast:** Old way vs. new way (implicitly tied to ClinicalSim.ai, but do NOT list features first)
6. **Proof:** One short customer story with contrast (before/after) using the PICU fellows pilot study, plus 1–2 external stats
7. **Power Positions:** 3 "Only with us, you can…" statements in "YOU phrasing" that describe what the customer can do differently (not features)
8. **Executive alignment:**
   - **DIO angle** (ACGME compliance, milestone achievement, program competitiveness, accreditation risk)
   - **CFO angle** (HCAHPS revenue protection, malpractice cost reduction, cost per training hour, SP cost displacement)
   - **CMO angle** (patient safety, provider competency assurance, communication-related adverse events)
   - **Simulation Center Director angle** (throughput, utilization, extending reach beyond physical sim center, demonstrating ROI)
   - **Program Director angle** (resident preparedness, milestone documentation, training accessibility, learner satisfaction)
   - **Risk Manager angle** (claims reduction, grievance prevention, documentation of communication competency training)

### Section D — "Big Picture" napkin sketch concepts

Provide 2–3 simple metaphors/diagrams I can draw live in a meeting.

Each must include:
- **Customer obstacles** → **gains** → **memorable metaphor**
- Must position the villain as an environmental shift (not "your people are failing")
- Should be drawable in under 60 seconds on a whiteboard

Consider these metaphor directions:
- The "flight simulator" analogy (pilots practice hundreds of hours before flying passengers; physicians practice the hardest conversation of their career... zero times?)
- The "fire drill" concept (you don't wait for the fire to teach people how to respond)
- The "practice reps" gap (athletes get thousands of practice reps; your residents get 2–4 per year for conversations that determine whether a family trusts your institution)

### Section E — Talk tracks that are NOT feature-led

For each POV:

1. **60-second opening** (hammock-style) for first 10 minutes of a meeting
   - Must open with a grabber (stat or "what if you could" question)
   - Must establish the pain before mentioning ClinicalSim.ai
   - Must earn the right to ask discovery questions

2. **3 discovery questions** I've "earned the right" to ask after sharing insight
   - These should be questions the prospect hasn't been asked before
   - They should reveal pain that connects to ClinicalSim.ai's value wedge
   - They should make the prospect think, not just confirm what they already know

3. **30-second close** that ends with: "You've seen how, only with us, you can [PP1] and [PP2] and [PP3]. So, where do we go from here?" style directness

---

## 5) Constraints and quality bar

- **Do NOT center the story on "we're a simulation tool."** Treat simulation as table stakes. The story is about what the customer can DO differently.
- **Do NOT lead with "AI."** Enterprise healthcare buyers are skeptical of AI claims (per the Accenture transcript insight: "all [enterprises are] very afraid of AI... and it slows everything down"). Position AI as the enabler, not the headline.
- **Avoid generic claims** like "simulation improves confidence" unless you provide the mechanism (WHY it improves confidence, for WHOM, and what changes as a result).
- **Emphasize:** on-demand availability, just-in-time practice before real encounters, validated assessment, scalability, cost displacement, and the "practice reps" gap.
- **Be explicit about assumptions;** separate facts vs. hypotheses.
- **Use simple language;** avoid buzzword soup. If you use terms like "just-in-time training," define them in plain English the first time.
- **The villain is NEVER the program director, the faculty, or the residents.** The villain is the environmental reality: difficult conversations are rare, unpredictable, and emotionally devastating — and our training model was built for a world where physicians learned by watching, not practicing.
- **Remember the Power Messaging principle:** "Too many salespeople want to lead with the strengths of their product or service. The problem is that the customer isn't ready to hear about them." Build emotional momentum FIRST.

---

## 6) Final recommendation

Conclude with:

1. **The single strongest POV to lead with** (and why — which buyer persona does it unlock first, and how does it cascade to other stakeholders?)

2. **The two best "villains"** (environmental shifts) that create urgency without blaming anyone at the prospect institution

3. **The top 5 proof assets to package for sales**, specifically:
   - The single most powerful grabber statistic (with source)
   - The best customer story with contrast (from the pilot study)
   - The best "Big Picture" napkin diagram
   - The best one-pager angle for each of the two primary buyer personas (DIO/Program Director and CFO/CMO)
   - The best third-party validation point (ACGME requirement, malpractice data, or HCAHPS evidence)

4. **Recommended next evidence investments** — what 2–3 studies or data points would most strengthen the sales case if pursued in the next 12 months?

---

## Key data points to have at your fingertips (pre-loaded from prior research)

Use these validated findings as your starting evidence base. Verify/update with current web research, but these provide the foundation:

- Only **12% of medical faculty** report being "very familiar" with AI technologies
- **60.5% of GME sponsoring institutions** have 5 or fewer programs (community hospital opportunity)
- Traditional SP encounters cost **$150–$300 per session** including all overhead
- VitalTalk costs **$500–$1,500 per clinician** for live training
- Most residents receive **2–4 formal communication simulation sessions** across entire residency
- Pilot study showed learners valued: rehearsing exact wording, reduced social pressure, feeling prepared, structured feedback
